Key:
! = cannot fully complete until other things have been made
!? = ! but not sure
(?) = extra thing; not required

1. Write basic game logic
2. Introduce proper gaps or whatever for AI to work with
3. Make sure game logic follows the rules
4. Temporary: create player turnaround (so I'm the player and AI for now)
5. Figure out how to save game data once user is done with game/needs to save it

Items for game data:
Points for each player
Words played for each player(?) (& points from each word??)
Time remaining for each player
Deck of player
Tiles remaining
GameBoard

Idea to save GameBoard:
list per row, special symbols for the special tiles, couple with letters if they're present
